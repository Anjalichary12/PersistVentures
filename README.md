-To generate an invoice in a format matching the one shown in the image you provided, I will guide you through a possible implementation using Python. 
-Here's an approach that leverages HTML templates and PDF generation.
-We'll use libraries such as Jinja2 for templating and pdfkit or WeasyPrint for rendering HTML into PDF format.

-->Install Required Libraries
First, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed:
### pip install jinja2 pdfkit weasyprint
-->You may also need to install wkhtmltopdf for pdfkit to work:
### sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf
-->Run the Python Script
### python generate_invoice.py


-->What the Script Does:


Loads Data        : The script loads your seller, billing, shipping, and item details into a data dictionary.
Calculates Totals : For each item, the script computes the net amount, tax, and total cost.
Fills the Template: Using Jinja2, the script fills in the HTML template with the invoice data.
Generates PDF     : Using WeasyPrint, the script converts the rendered HTML into a PDF file.
Saves PDF         : The final PDF invoice is saved as invoice.pdf.
-->Customization
Logo and Signature: Replace logo.png and signature.png with your actual logo and signature images.
Add New Items     : You can easily add more items by expanding the items list in the data dictionary.
Taxes             : The script automatically calculates taxes based on the tax_rate provided (18% in this example)
